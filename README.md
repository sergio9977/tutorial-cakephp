# Development Environment

This application is defined with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) V1.
Docker Compose is included in [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/).

## Ports

Docker Compose for development environment exposes following ports:

- 80 (HTTP) http://localhost/
- 3306 (MySQL) username and password are set in [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)

If another application is using these ports, Docker Compose can't start.
Please stop that application before starting Docker Compose.

## PHP

Docker Compose has `php-app` service.
Use it to run Composer or CakePHP commands.
Commands in Docker Compose run at [app](app) directory.

For example, run following command after `docker-compose up` to install dependencies:

```sh
docker-compose exec php-app composer install
```

### Debugging

The Docker Compose for `php-app` service had been configured with debugging engine Xdebug.
Please configure the IDE with debugging support for Xdebug.

### Basic Coding Standard & Quality

To ensure the written code following the basic coding standard & quality, we've configured the Docker Compose for `php-app` service with tools:
1. PHP Code Sniffer (PHPCS) based on CakePHP coding standard rules.
2. PHPStan - PHP Static Analysis Tool.

Everytime making a changes to the code, please run both commands as follows:

```sh
docker-compose exec php-app composer cs-check
```

```sh
docker-compose exec php-app composer stan
```

If either both tools complaint about errors, then please fix following the basic coding standard & quality.

# Tutorial CakePHP
